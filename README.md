# Semantic Markup
The goal for this project is to refactor the exsisting code using semantic markup to be more accessible for all users visiting the webpage.
As well as compressing the CSS style code to make the file smaller and able to load faster, while still keeping the page looking and fuctioning the same.

Semantic markup tags make the page easier for screen readers to provide the information to users who are unable to see the content or need a summary.
Through this assignment, I learned what semantic markup is,what screen readers are and what they are used for, and how to compress CSS code to allow for a faster loading time and reduce the size of the file.
I also learned how to use the git push, git pull, git commit and git status commands, and gained a better understanding of what i was doing when using these commands.

The most challenging part of this assignment for me was learning the different uses for the semantic tags and figuring out where they would be appropriate in the code.

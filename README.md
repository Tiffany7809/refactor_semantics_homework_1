# refactor_semantics_homework_1
First homework assignment for Boot camp

For this assignment, the goal was to add semantic tags to the HTML code to allow for better accesability for a wider range of users. 
As well as condensing the CSS style sheet where possible to allow the web page to load faster.

Through this, I have learned the difference between non-semantic HTML tags like div and semantic tags like section, article, and header.
I also learned what screen readers are and what purpose they serve.

The most challenging part of this for me was working with git hub and coming to better understand the use of git add, git pull, git push and git commit ono gitbash.
